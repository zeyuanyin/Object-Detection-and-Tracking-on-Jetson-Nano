## Image Classification

1) Follow the [repo](https://github.com/weiaicunzai/pytorch-cifar100) to get the base models.
2) Use the quantization/pruning methods to get a light models.
3) Evaluate the light models and record the performance.


## Object Detection

1) Follow the [repo](https://github.com/dusty-nv/pytorch-ssd) to get the base models.
2) Use the quantization/pruning methods to get a light models.
3) Evaluate the light models and record the performance.
4) Export the pytorch models into the onnx files and run it at Jetson Nano.


## Object Tracking

1) Export the pytorch models into the onnx files.
2) Evaluate the onnx models on the video data at Jetson Nano.
